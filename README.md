Here's an improved version of your `README.md` file:

# VideoApp

VideoApp is a Django-based application designed for generating thumbnails from videos using Celery with Redis for task management.

## Setup Instructions

Before running the application, ensure Redis is installed and running on your machine.

### Start Celery Worker

Open a terminal and run the following command to start the Celery worker:
```bash
celery -A server worker -l info
```

### Run the Django Server

Open another terminal session to run the Django server:
```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

## User Experience

### Authorization

Users need to authenticate to use the application.

#### If already a user:

- **SignUp**: Create a new user with username, email, and password.

#### If not a user:

- **Login**: Provide username, email, and password.
  - Incorrect username or email leads to rejection.
  - Incorrect password leads to rejection.
  - Successful login generates an authentication token.

### File Upload and Thumbnail Generation

Users must be authenticated to upload files and generate thumbnails.

1. **Upload a Video**:
   - Provide video title, description, and upload the video file.
   - Upon successful validation, the project is saved, and thumbnail generation is initiated via Celery.
   - The task ID is returned for tracking.

2. **Fetch File with Task ID**:
   - Once thumbnails are generated:
     - Images are displayed and can be downloaded by clicking on them.
   - If thumbnails are not yet generated, a "working" status is returned.

This setup and functionality ensure a streamlined process for video thumbnail generation within the VideoApp.
